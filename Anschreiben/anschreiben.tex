%    \blindtext

When I first saw your job advertisement for this position it felt like the perfect match! Let me explain why:
%In my job I enjoy working with SAP technology every day and also collaborate closely with your colleagues from SAP Data Management and Landscape Transformation in the Selective Data Transition Engagement. 
The first time I was introduced to Robot Process Automation was on last year's TechED in Barcelona - I was instantly amazed by this technology. Hyperautomation is the next level and I would love to contribute to its development.

You're looking for a leader with a strong technical background who can build self-organizing and high-performing teams focusing on development in many dimensions. 
As an Engineering Manager, Solution Owner and Lead Engineer in a startup environment within Schneider-Neureither and Partner SE (SNP) it seems like I'm an excellent fit.

I've built a team of 5 developers that is specialized in automating complex SAP landscape transformations. We use results from Artificial Intelligence and Programming Language Design to achieve this goal. 
Enabling a human-centered design and development process with a strong focus on quality and value is my first priority.

I enjoy collaboration and communication and I love to see ambitious vision turn into reality.
I'm ready for the best run and looking forward talking to you personally.


    \closing{Sincerely yours,}

%    \ps PS: Dies ist ein Postskriptum.
